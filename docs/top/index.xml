      <description>Welcome to my blog, where I try and share real world tips and techniques covering practical aspects of network automation, monitoring, configuration management and other infrastructure related problems. I am a Network Engineer turned Network Automation guy / Network Reliability Engineer who loves building micro-service based frameworks for the monitoring, provisioning and deployment of large/web scale network environments. I am a fan of Open Source but less so than building things myself to get the job done :) I prefer coding in Golang and Python and recently have developed an active interest in front end development using React-JS.</description>
