      <description>Mayuresh is a Network Engineer turned Network Automation guy / Network Reliability Engineer. He loves building micro-service based frameworks for the monitoring, provisioning and deployment of large/web scale network environments. He is a fan of Open Source but less so than building things himself to get the job done :) He loves coding in Golang and Python and recently has developed an active interest in front end development using React-JS.</description>
