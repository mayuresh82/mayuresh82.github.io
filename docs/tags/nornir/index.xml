      <description>Building Dynamic Inventories in Nornir Organizing your Nornir inventory into multiple groups based on device attributes is a useful feature that allows running tasks against specific groups of hosts. Other frameworks like Ansible ship with a powerful dynamic inventory management system that allows grouping and filtering. While Nornir 3.0 has a community driven Netbox Plugin, it is pretty basic and includes a simple way to pull in hosts from Netbox. In this blog post, we will see how we can extend this Netbox plugin to build a dynamic inventory with powerful grouping and run-time filtering capabilities.</description>
