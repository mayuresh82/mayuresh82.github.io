      <description>2017 was the year of the Software Defined Network (SDN). Apart from other things like new players jumping onto the SDN space and a bunch of new SD-WAN offerings, two prominent innovation leaders - Google and Facebook - both released blogs and papers on their software defined edge network. Google&amp;rsquo;s solution; named Espresso, is likely a more battle tested and production-hardened solution owning to years of R&amp;amp;D and testing. It is, however (or at least in my opinion) a lot more complex than Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Edge Fabric that uses a much simpler approach to solving the same problem - which is to overcome BGP&amp;rsquo;s inability to take link performance ( which translates to application performance) into account for its routing decisions.</description>
