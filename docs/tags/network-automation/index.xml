      <description>The importance of User Interfaces for Network Automation One of the least talked about aspects of network automation workflows is the ability to interface with the different tools and frameworks that enable these workflows. Consider a scenario where you are part of a small team of Network Engineers in a small company that has a small but growing customer base.

      <description>Getting Started with Network Automation Network Automation is the “art” of automating repetitive tasks related to network provisioning, deployment, monitoring and alerting. The reason its an art is because you can conceptualize and develop very creative methods to achieve your network automation goals. To get started, it is important to first identify a problem that needs to be solved, ideally a simple one. This helps establish clear goals and helps navigate the myriad web of libraries and open source tools available at your disposal.</description>
