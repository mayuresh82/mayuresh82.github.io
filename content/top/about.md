![](/img/avatar.jpg)  **_Mayuresh_** is a Network Engineer turned Network Automation guy / Network Reliability Engineer. He loves building micro-service based frameworks for the monitoring, provisioning and deployment of large/web scale network environments. He is a fan of Open Source but less so than building things himself to get the job done :) He loves coding in Golang and Python and recently has developed an active interest in front end development using React-JS. 

Career wise, he has led web scale network automation efforts at Facebook and Roblox over the last decade. Prior to Network Automation, he was mostly involved with network design and operations for vendors and ISPs. He holds dual active CCIE certifications (# 33010 ).

When he is not working, he is mostly found lifting weights in the gym or recovering in the kitchen.
