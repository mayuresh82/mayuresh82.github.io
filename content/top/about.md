![](/img/avatar.jpg)  Welcome to my blog, where I try and share real world tips and techniques covering practical aspects of network automation, monitoring, configuration management and other infrastructure related problems. I am a Network Engineer turned Network Automation guy / Network Reliability Engineer who loves building micro-service based frameworks for the monitoring, provisioning and deployment of large/web scale network environments. I am a fan of Open Source but less so than building things myself to get the job done :) I prefer coding in Golang and Python and recently have developed an active interest in front end development using React-JS. 

Career wise, I have led web scale network automation efforts at Facebook and Roblox over the last decade. Prior to Network Automation, I was mostly involved with network design and operations for vendors and ISPs. I hold dual active CCIE certifications (# 33010 ).

When I am not working, I am mostly found lifting weights in the gym or recovering in the kitchen.
